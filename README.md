My project is called Curious Crossroads.

To play, you must text the Twilio account 'start' to begin the game. Continue choosing differet paths by texting one of the two choices given for each prompt. The game is over once you are given a final fate and Twilio returns "Send 'start' to play again."

Have fun!

P.S. Things/people who helped include Mr. Jiang, patience, and Coca-Cola :)
